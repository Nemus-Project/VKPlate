# VKPlate

Implementation of a Föppl-von Karmàn (VK) plate.

## About

Simulation of a von-Karman plate written in modal formalism, using scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) method.

## Getting started

### Cloning this repisitory

Submodule (Matthew add this)

### Directory setup

The main.m code needs an input in the form of a .mat file. You can either generate it with genparams.m and store it in a param folder in the top level of the repository

OR download the param.zip folder attached to this release (add link) in the top level of the repository and unzip.

Your directory stucture should look like this : (TBA)

### Using main.m

Everything is written in ther in a super explicit fashion, I took ages writing it, enjoy

### Example

![16-mode modal plate doing with initial excitation](./img/modeplate.gif)

## Goals

Energy conservation (which is achieved). Later versions will have means to excite the plate instead of an initial displacement.
