# What is this

## About

First code generate modal basis with user defined parameters and boundary conditions, second code solves the modal problem and can plot the resulting displacement

### Example

![16-mode modal plate doing with initial excitation](./img/modeplate.gif)

## Goals

Energy conservation (which is achieved). Later versions will have means to excite the plate instead of an initial displacement.
